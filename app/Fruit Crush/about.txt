Fruit Crush functions as a classic match-3 puzzle game where the player interacts with a grid of colorful fruit icons on their Android device. The core mechanic revolves around swapping adjacent fruits to align sets of three or more identical items, causing them to burst and disappear from the board. As matches are made, the game logic—contained within the :app module included in your settings—calculates scores and triggers a cascading effect where new fruits fall from the top to fill the empty spaces. This falling mechanism can lead to exciting chain reactions, allowing players to rack up high scores with a single strategic move. The game is likely organized into levels, each presenting unique challenges such as reaching a specific score, clearing gelatinous obstacles, or collecting a set number of specific ingredients. Players must achieve these goals within a limited number of moves or a specific time limit, adding a layer of strategy and urgency to the gameplay.
        Advanced gameplay mechanics involve creating matches of four or five fruits, which generate powerful special items instead of simply clearing the board. For instance, matching four fruits might create a striped fruit that clears an entire row or column, while matching five can produce a "color bomb" that eliminates all fruits of a single type. Combining these special power-ups creates massive explosions, essential for clearing difficult levels with restrictive move limits. The project uses the pluginManagement and dependencyResolutionManagement blocks in settings.gradle to pull necessary libraries from Google and Maven Central repositories, ensuring the game's graphics and audio engines run smoothly. The user interface typically tracks progress with a star rating system, encouraging replayability to achieve a perfect score on every stage. Behind the scenes, the Gradle build tool manages these dependencies to compile the project into a functional APK. Ultimately, Fruit Crush combines vibrant visuals, satisfying audio feedback, and strategic puzzle-solving to create an engaging casual gaming experience.
